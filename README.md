## Async Race

The main goal of this task was to develop an SPA application to imitate an asynchronous car race game. We used an web-server to get info about cars and had to handle different errors.

### Before starting an application you should start web-server! (instructions are below)

## How to start a Web-server:

1. Clone repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/dumbus/async-race.git
```
2. Change active directory:
```
cd async-race/server
```
3. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```
4. Start web-server:
```
npm start
```

> Use node 14.x or higher

## How to start an Application:

1. Open new terminal

2. Change active directory to `async-race`

3. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```
4. Start application:
```
npm run start
```
